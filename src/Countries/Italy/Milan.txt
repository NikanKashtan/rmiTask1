the largest city in the north of the country and its main economic and financial center.

fashion and design. The date of foundation of Milan is considered 600 BC. e.,
and its present name is derived from the Roman "Mediolanum" ("middle of the plain")
that very accurately describes the position of the city, stretching in the middle reaches
of the rivers Olona and Lambro.Significantly damaged during the Second World War,
the city was a third rebuilt,so wonderfully combines in his appearance medieval monuments
and cutting-edge business districts.
