The largest city in Scotland - Glasgow (Glasgow, in translation from Celtic - "dear green place").
The city is really quite expensive and the whole is surrounded by greenery, but it has a very distinctive
architectural appearance, combining Gothic, Italian Renaissance, Gregorian and Victorian styles.
Glasgow is the center of the arts in Scotland and the venue for numerous festivals.
